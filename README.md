# TournamentParser
Parses .wer files (XML files created by Wizards Event Reporter) and
pull out the names and player ID number of each indivdual player, the event date, and the number of participants

My plan is to eventually encorporate parsing .Tournament files (Konami Tournament Software xml files) into this eventually

Currently will just print to the screen, but eventually will export to a spreadsheet. Eventual plan is to let you create an event you are storing points for and then selecting that event before tournaments are scanned.
